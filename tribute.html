                <blockquote>
                "Dr. Tommy Lee Osborn was a great man of God 
            who preached and practicalized the love of God 
            to humanity with great passion and confidence. 
            He emphasized the love and compassion of God,
            rather than the "fire and brimstone" theology style
                commonly used by evangelists of the era, 
            and Dr. T.L. Osborn practiced supernatural healing in their meetings.
            The world missed him."</blockquote>
